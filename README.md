This is a readme for the team project

## Introduction

Here you can find everything you need to know about the team application, from team 'Cascading style peepz'.

This application collects data from each team member's personal website, showcasing a preview of their website, additional information, and a link to their website.

## Process

First we checked which of the personal data was relevant, and which of the data we wanted to display on the team website. We ended up going for the theme of (favorite) animals. 

<!-- put the sketch here. -->
![prototype]() 

So, we display each member's personal website, some information (including the animals) and we wanted some fun interaction/animation, so we added a waving stickmen with each of the face of our avatars.

I wanted to make a portfolio. I'm wasn't completely sure where I wanted to go with it and didn't want to waste too much time on designing instead of coding, so I kept the design simple and I changed my idea about what it was going to be as I was coding it. Now it's just a preview of showing the projects I worked on without much information.
